# Cell simulation ðŸ§«

## The project

This is my first project about the discovery of the systems biology field. Personally I find the study of nature and biology from a computational point of view really fascinating, since it helps having another perspective on science.

During the last years more and more engineers and researchers are producing theories and methods in order to study complicated problems using analogies with nature and its rising complexity from simple rules. A great example is given in the book *******A new kind of science*******, written by Stephen Wolfram (the founder of Wolfram Alpha, Mathematica and many more softwares used by scientist and engineers around the world). With it Mr. Wolfram explains its own perspective about an approach to a scientific method which is about finding the basic behaviours that generates the phenomena of study.

The notion I will try to represent with this and my future projects are based on study of textbooks and papers. In particular the current program is realized by studying the following resources (*******************in constant update*******************):

- *[An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9780429283321/introduction-systems-biology-uri-alon)*

## Technologies involved

This simulation is all built using the p5js library.

## Running the scripts

You can run the scripts locally using VSCode LiveServer plugin.
